ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Matthieu-Gerard, PhD in combinatorial optimization.

ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in algorithms design in:
  - Operations Research OR, 
  - Machine Learning ML,
  - Deep Learning DL.
  
ðŸ“« You could reach me on https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthieu-g%C3%A9rard-a1849416/.

ðŸŒ± I will gradually release some basic projects that I did during my personnal time such as: 
  - Simplex algorithm solver for linear problem, 
  - Heuristic for Travelling salesman problem (TSP), 
  - Bactracking algorithm for sudoku,
  - Feedforward neural network used for instance for MNIST recognition,
  - Diverses basic AI that play tic-tac-toe or chess,
  - And more !
